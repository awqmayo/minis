		<p>Leader of the Suebi, Ariovistus led a confederation of Germanic tribes to Gaul aiding allied tribes of the Arverni against the Aedui. Their success was upturned by the arrival of Julius Caesar and the battle of Vosges. All the detail we have comes from Caesar’s Rex Germanorum. At one point Ariovistus was seen by the Roman senate as friend, but increasing migrations from across the Rhine caused consternation amongst Rome and her Gaulish allies. Ariovistus refused all demands to quell the tide of settlers and ridiculed Rome, even inviting Caesar to attack - an offer the power hungry consul could not refuse. In the aftermath of the battle the former war leader fled back across the Rhine and into political obscurity – at least in the eyes of Rome.</p>

		<p>This figure was a joy to paint.  A bit larger than 28mm, more like a 35mm figure, it is highly detailed.  The fur is excellently sculpted, and his welath implies a lavish decoration with exotic pigmentation.  The dogs in the background provide an excellent basis for a scenic base, and are easily painted with simply black washes preceding upwards in strength.</p>

		<p>This figure was the first figure I painted that really clicked for me, partially due to its larger scale, or the fact that the man depicted was quite large, as fitting of a Northern barbarian stereotype.  The vallejo flesh paint set helped me exponentially, compared with the foundry paints I had been using previously.  I painted it over the course of around 48 hours, during two days of winter vacation, and it is still one of the figures I am most happy with.  </p>
